*# Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench*


*Project Description:*
This project aims to conduct data analysis in the context of the fictional company Mint Classics. I will be playing the role of a novice data analyst assisting the company in addressing inventory and storage facility-related issues. The problem at hand involves the decision to close one of the existing storage facilities.


*Demonstrated Skills:*
1. Data Analysis: I will use SQL to extract and analyze data from the Mint Classics relational database.
2. Business Understanding: I will grasp the database structure and Mint Classics' business processes to provide relevant solutions.
3. Decision-Making: I will formulate recommendations based on findings from data analysis.


*Tools Used:*
1. MySQL Workbench: This tool is utilized for importing the database, running SQL queries, and analyzing data.
2. GitHub: The project and reports will be uploaded to GitHub as part of the portfolio.

*The following will be analyzed in this project:*
1. Are there products with high inventory but low sales? How can we optimize the inventory of these products?
2. Are all the warehouses currently in use still necessary? How can we review warehouses with low or inactive inventory?
3. Is there a relationship between product prices and their sales levels? How can price adjustments impact sales?
4. Who are the customers contributing the most to sales? How can we focus sales efforts on these valuable customers?
5. How can sales employee performance be evaluated using sales data?
6. How can customer payment trends be analyzed? What credit risks should be monitored, and how can cash flow be managed?
7. How can the performance of various product lines be compared? Which products are the most successful, and which ones need improvement or removal?
8. How can the company's credit policies be evaluated? Are there customers with credit issues that need to be addressed?
